## Project Scope
    A application designed to give parking information to make it easier for the users to find parking. For system limitations will depend on the mobile device, as well as the fact that it is strictly limited to mobile devices and no other platform. This application will be able to work on Android and IOS. Users are not required to have @radford.edu emails to use this application as this will be an option to save preferences, user will be given the ability to continue as a guest on the application. Access will include Radford Students/faculty and regular (or “visitor”) users.  User access levels will be determined by user input upon clicking the prospective buttons . The users will be able to use the interactive map to find information on the different parking lots operated by Radford campus. The user will be able to see parking availability, available times of the lot, and busy hours. The data provided in the interactive map will display an overall heatmap of all parking, as well as specific heatmaps for each lot based upon parking data and estimated frequency.
